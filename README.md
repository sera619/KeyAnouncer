# KeyAnouncer - WoW Addon

## Description:
Keystone Tracker is a simple yet effective addon for World of Warcraft that allows players to share and view Mythic+ keystones within their party. By leveraging the game's addon communication system, Keystone Tracker makes it easy for party members to know who has which keystone, helping the group coordinate Mythic+ runs more effectively.

## Features:
- Automatic Keystone Detection: The addon automatically scans the player's inventory for their Mythic+ keystone.
- Addon Communication: Shares your keystone information with other party members who also have the addon installed.
- Party Keystone Overview: Displays the keystones of all party members who use the addon, allowing for quick decision-making when choosing a Mythic+ dungeon.
- Lightweight and User-Friendly: The addon is lightweight, with minimal impact on performance and requires no manual setup.

## How It Works:
1. Upon joining a party, the addon automatically detects your Mythic+ keystone and shares its details with other party members using the addon.
2. The addon listens for incoming keystone information from other party members and displays the collected data in the chat or on the UI.
3. If a player does not have a keystone or is not using the addon, no data will be displayed for them.

## Requirements:
All party members need to have the addon installed for full functionality.

Compatible with World of Warcraft's latest expansion and patch.
